Maya scripts I made in order to speed up my workflow

# How to load scripts on Maya

* Open Maya (whatever version is fine)
* Click on the [small button with a semicolumn](screenshots/MayaScriptEditorButton.png?raw=true) on the lower-right edge of the screen
* On the [new window that has been opened](screenshots/MayaScriptEditor.png?raw=true) and click on File > Load script
* Click on the [ExecuteAll button](screenshots/MayaExecuteAllButton.png?raw=true) (the icon that looks like a fast-forward button)

# How to use the scripts
