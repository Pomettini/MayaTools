Maya scripts I made in order to speed up my workflow

# How to load scripts on Maya

* Open Maya (whatever version is fine)
* Click on the small button with a semicolumn on the lower-right edge of the screen
* On the new window that has opened click on File > Load script
* Click on the ExecuteAll button (the icon that looks like a fast-forward button)
